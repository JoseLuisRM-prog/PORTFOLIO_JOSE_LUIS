- **Tools**: Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn)

### 6. Predictive Analysis of Stroke Risk Factors
- **Description**: Analysis of risk variables for strokes with predictive models.
- **Methodology**: Data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature visualization, model construction, and evaluation.
- **Tools**: Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn)

## Technical Skills

- **Languages**: Python, R
- **Libraries and Tools**:
  - **Python**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.neighbors.
  - **R**: dplyr, ggplot2, corrplot, randomForest, caret, e1071 primarily.
